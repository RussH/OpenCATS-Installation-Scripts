# OpenCATS-Installation-Scripts
See Documentation for Script usage.

To use the installation run file (works, but there may be bugs, so consider it Beta), see instructions below:

Built for Ubuntu 18.04 Only.
Download the run file

sudo chmod +x /filelocation/opencats-0.9.4-3-linux-x64-installer.run
sudo ./opencats-0.9.4-3-linux-x64-installer.run

Please note, it take between 5-10 minutes for the install, it looks like it's hanging up at 100%, but that is normal.  If there's any errors, it WILL give you an error message.

If you have any errors, please let us know!
